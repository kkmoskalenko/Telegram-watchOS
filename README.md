# Telegram watchOS

## Compilation Guide

1. Rename `Config.sample.xcconfig` to `Config.xcconfig` and fill in your own `api_id` and `api_hash` (can be obtained at https://my.telegram.org)

## Building TDLib for watchOS 6

**You do NOT have to follow the steps below, because this repesotiry already contains prebuilt TDLib binaries. Iâ€™ve written this instruction as a reminder for myself.**

1. Clone the [TDLib repository](https://github.com/tdlib/td) from GitHub and see the instructions in `example/ios`.

2. Run commands from `example/ios/build-openssl.sh` line-by-line manually, but right after clonning the `Python-Apple-support` repo and switching to the specified commit, edit the `Python-Apple-support/Makefile` starting at line 58:

   ```diff
     # watchOS targets
   - TARGETS-watchOS=watchsimulator.i386 watchos.armv7k
   + TARGETS-watchOS=watchsimulator.i386 watchsimulator.x86_64 watchos.armv7k watchos.arm64_32
     CFLAGS-watchOS=-mwatchos-version-min=4.0
     CFLAGS-watchos.armv7k=-fembed-bitcode
   + CFLAGS-watchos.arm64_32=-fembed-bitcode
     PYTHON_CONFIGURE-watchOS=ac_cv_func_sigaltstack=no
   ```

   > The idea behind this solution is from a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/tdlib/td/issues/745).

3. Edit `CMake/iOS.cmake` starting at line 199:

   ```diff
   elseif (IOS_PLATFORM STREQUAL "WATCHOS")
   -   set (IOS_ARCH "armv7k")
   +   set (IOS_ARCH "armv7k;arm64_32")
   elseif (IOS_PLATFORM STREQUAL "WATCHSIMULATOR")
   -   set (IOS_ARCH "i386")
   +   set (IOS_ARCH "i386;x86_64")
   ```

4. Edit `example/ios/build.sh` at line 59:

   ```diff
   - cmake $td_path $options -DIOS_PLATFORM=${ios_platform} -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${td_path}/CMake/iOS.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../${install}
   + cmake $td_path $options -DIOS_PLATFORM=${ios_platform} -DIOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=6.0 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${td_path}/CMake/iOS.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../${install}
   ```

5. Run the `example/ios/build.sh` script, but only for the watchOS platform.

   Built library will be stored in `tdjson` directory. It will work on any Apple Watch architecture (`armv7k`, `arm64_32`) and even on a simulator (`i386`, `x86_64`).
